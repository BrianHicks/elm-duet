# An example app that uses JWTs to manage authentication. Imagine that the JWTs
# are stored in localStorage so that they can persist across sessions. The
# lifecycle of this app might look like:
#
# 1. On init, the JS side passes the Elm runtime the current value of the JWT
#    (or `null`, if unset)
# 2. Elm is responsible for authentication and for telling JS when it gets a
#    new JWT (for example, when the user logs in)
# 3. Elm is also responsible for telling JS if someone logs out, in which case
#    we should clear the JWT from localStorage.

# For elm-duet, we start by defining our data types. In this case, we're just
# going to keep things simple and define a "jwt" that will just be an alias to
# a string.
definitions:
  jwt:
    type: string

# Now we say how to use it. Each key in this object is a module in your Elm
# application, in which we can define our flags and ports.
modules:
  Main:
    # First we'll define flags. As we mentioned above, that's either a JWT or
    # null. We'll define it by referring to
    #
    # If your app doesn't use flags, you can omit this key.
    flags:
      properties:
        currentJwt:
          ref: jwt
          nullable: true

    # Next we'll do ports. As with flags, if your app doesn't use ports, you
    # can omit this key.
    ports:
      # Like flags, ports are specified with a JTD schema. In this case, we
      # want a non-nullable version of the same JWT as earlier.
      #
      # Ports also have a direction. We specify this in the
      # `metadata.direction` key, either `ElmToJs` or `JsToElm`.
      newJwt:
        metadata:
          direction: ElmToJs
        ref: jwt

      # Logout is a bit different: we really don't need a payload, just a
      # signal. JTD handles this by defining an "empty" case, which we specify
      # by omitting any type information. We still need to know which direction
      # the port has to move, though, so we still include the metadata.
      logout:
        metadata:
          direction: ElmToJs
