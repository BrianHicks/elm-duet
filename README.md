# elm-duet

I like Elm and TypeScript for building apps, but I find it annoying to make the boundary between them type-safe.

I can get around this in various ways, of course, either by maintaining a definitions by hand or generating one side from the other.
In general, though, you run into a couple different issues:

- It's easy for one side or the other to get out of date and errors to slip through CI and code review into production.
- Definitions in one language may not be translatable to the other (despite the two type systems having a high degree of overlap.)

`elm-duet` tries to get around this by creating a single source of truth to generate both TypeScript definitions and Elm types with decoders.
We use [JSON Type Definitions](https://jsontypedef.com/) (JTD, [five-minute tutorial](https://jsontypedef.com/docs/jtd-in-5-minutes/)) to say precisely what we want and generate ergonomic types on both sides (plus helpers like encoders to make testing easy!)

In addition, `elm-duet` produces files that make following good practices around interop easier!
I'll call those out as we get to them.

## Example 1: JWTs

Here's an example for an app that stores [JWTs](https://jwt.io/) in `localStorage`:

```yaml {source=examples/jwt_schema.yaml}
# An example schema that uses JWTs to manage authentication. Imagine that the
# JWTs are stored in localStorage so that they can persist across sessions. The
# lifecycle of this app might look like:
#
# 1. On init, the JS side passes the Elm runtime the current value of the JWT
#    (or `null`, if unset)
# 2. Elm is responsible for authentication and for telling JS when it gets a
#    new JWT (for example, when the user logs in)

# For elm-duet, we start by defining our data types. In this case, we're just
# going to keep things simple and define a "jwt" that will just be an alias to
# a string.
definitions:
  jwt:
    type: string

# Now we say how to use it. Each key in this object is a module in your Elm
# application, in which we can define our flags and ports.
modules:
  Main:
    # First we'll define flags. As we mentioned above, that's either a JWT or
    # null. We'll define it by referring to `jwt` from above.
    #
    # If your app doesn't use flags, you can omit this key.
    flags:
      properties:
        currentJwt:
          ref: jwt
          nullable: true

    # Next we'll do ports. As with flags, if your app doesn't use ports, you
    # can omit this key.
    ports:
      # Like flags, ports are specified with a JTD schema. In this case, we
      # want a non-nullable version of the same JWT as earlier.
      #
      # Ports also have a direction. We specify this in the
      # `metadata.direction` key, either `ElmToJs` or `JsToElm`.
      newJwt:
        metadata:
          direction: ElmToJs
        ref: jwt

```

(We're using YAML in this example so we can use comments, but JSON schemas also work just fine.)

You can generate code from this by calling `elm-duet path/to/your/schema.(yaml|json)`:

```console
$ elm-duet examples/jwt_schema.yaml --typescript-dest examples/jwt_schema.ts --elm-dest examples/jwt_schema
wrote examples/jwt_schema.ts
wrote examples/jwt_schema/Main/Flags.elm
wrote examples/jwt_schema/Main/Ports.elm
formatted TypeScript
formatted Elm

```

This produces this TypeScript file:

```typescript {source=examples/jwt_schema.ts}
// Warning: this file is automatically generated. Don't edit by hand!

declare module Elm {
  namespace Main {
    type Flags = {
      currentJwt: string | null;
    };

    type Ports = {
      newJwt?: {
        subscribe: (callback: (value: string) => void) => void;
      };
    };

    function init(config: { flags: Flags; node: HTMLElement }): {
      ports?: Ports;
    };
  }
}

```

This should be flexible enough to use both if you're embedding your Elm app (e.g. with `esbuild`) or referring to it as an external JS file.

We also get this file containing Elm flags:

```elm {source=examples/jwt_schema/Main/Flags.elm}
module Main.Flags exposing (..)

{-| Warning: this file is automatically generated. Don't edit by hand!
-}

import Json.Decode
import Json.Decode.Pipeline
import Json.Encode


type alias Flags =
    { currentJwt : Maybe String
    }


flagsDecoder : Decoder Flags
flagsDecoder =
    Json.Decode.succeed Flags
        |> Json.Decode.Pipeline.required "currentJwt" (Json.Decode.nullable Json.Decode.string)


encodeFlags : Flags -> Json.Encode.Value
encodeFlags flags =
    Json.Encode.object
        [ ( "currentJwt"
          , case flags.currentJwt of
                Just value ->
                    Json.Encode.string value

                Nothing ->
                    Json.Encode.null
          )
        ]

```

In your `init`, you can accept a `Json.Decode.Value` and call `Decode.decodeValue Main.Flags.flagsDecoder flags` to get complete control over the error experience.
It also lets you custom types in your flags, since you're specifying the decoder.

Note that `elm-duet` creates both decoders and encoders for all the types it generates.
This is to make your life easier during testing: you can hook up tools like [elm-program-test](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/avh4/elm-program-test/latest/) without having to redo your data encoding.

Finally, we have the ports:

```elm {source=examples/jwt_schema/Main/Ports.elm}
port module Main.Ports exposing (..)

{-| Warning: this file is automatically generated. Don't edit by hand!
-}

import Json.Decode
import Json.Decode.Pipeline
import Json.Encode


type alias NewJwt =
    String


newJwtDecoder : Decoder NewJwt
newJwtDecoder =
    Json.Decode.string


encodeNewJwt : NewJwt -> Json.Encode.Value
encodeNewJwt newJwt =
    Json.Encode.string newJwt


port newJwt : Value -> Cmd msg


sendNewJwt : NewJwt -> Cmd msg
sendNewJwt value =
    newJwt (encodeNewJwt value)

```

You'll notice that in addition to decoders and encoders, `elm-duet` generates type-safe wrappers around the ports.
This is, again, to let you send custom types through the ports in a way we control: if you specify an `enum`, for example, we ensure that both Elm and TypeScript have enough information to take advantage of the best parts of their respective type systems without falling back to plain strings.

Other than those helpers, we don't try to generate any particular helpers for constructing values.
Every app is going to have different needs there, and we expose everything you need to construct your own.

## Example 2: An All-in-One Port

Some people like to define an all-in-one port for their application to make sure that they only have a single place to hook up new messages.
`elm-duet` and JDT support this with discriminators and mappings:

```yaml {source=examples/all_in_one.yaml}
# Let's imagine that we're writing an app which handles some websocket messages
# that we want Elm to react to. We'll leave it up to Elm to interpret the data
# inside the messages, but we can use elm-duet to ensure that we have all the
# right types for each port event set up.
#
# For this example, we're going to define a port named `toWorld` that sends all
# our messages to JS in the same place, and the same for `fromWorld` for
# subscriptions. We could do this across many ports as well, of course, but if
# you prefer to put all your communication in one port, here's how you do it!
modules:
  Main:
    ports:
      toWorld:
        metadata:
          direction: ElmToJs

        # JTD lets us distinguish between different types of an object by using
        # the discriminator/mapping case. The first step is to define the field
        # that "tags" the message. In this case, we'll literally use `tag`:
        discriminator: tag

        # Next, tell JTD all the possible values of `tag` and what types are
        # associated with them. We'll use the same option as in the JWT schema
        # example, but all in one port. Note that all the options need to be
        # non-nullable objects, since we can't set a tag otherwise.
        mapping:
          connect:
            properties:
              url:
                type: string
              protocols:
                elements:
                  type: string
                nullable: true

          send:
            properties:
              message:
                type: string

          close:
            properties:
              code:
                type: uint8
              reason:
                type: string

      # since we're managing the websocket in JS, we need to pass events back
      # into Elm. Like `toWorld`, we'll use discriminator/mapping from JTD.
      fromWorld:
        metadata:
          direction: JsToElm
        discriminator: tag

        mapping:
          # There isn't any data in the `open` or `error` events, but we still
          # care about knowing that it happened. In this case, we specify an
          # empty object to signify that there is no additional data.
          open: {}
          error: {}

          close:
            properties:
              code:
                type: uint32
              reason:
                type: string
              wasClean:
                type: boolean

          message:
            properties:
              data:
                type: string
              origin:
                type: string

```

Again, we generate everything in `examples`:

```console
$ elm-duet examples/all_in_one.yaml --typescript-dest examples/all_in_one.ts --elm-dest examples/all_in_one
wrote examples/all_in_one.ts
wrote examples/all_in_one/Main/Ports.elm
formatted TypeScript
formatted Elm

```

We get this in TypeScript:

```typescript {source=examples/all_in_one.ts}
// Warning: this file is automatically generated. Don't edit by hand!

declare module Elm {
  namespace Main {
    type Flags = Record<string, never>;

    type Ports = {
      fromWorld?: {
        send: (
          value:
            | {
                code: number;
                reason: string;
                tag: "close";
                wasClean: boolean;
              }
            | {
                tag: "error";
              }
            | {
                data: string;
                origin: string;
                tag: "message";
              }
            | {
                tag: "open";
              },
        ) => void;
      };
      toWorld?: {
        subscribe: (
          callback: (
            value:
              | {
                  code: number;
                  reason: string;
                  tag: "close";
                }
              | {
                  protocols: string[] | null;
                  tag: "connect";
                  url: string;
                }
              | {
                  message: string;
                  tag: "send";
                },
          ) => void,
        ) => void;
      };
    };

    function init(config: { flags: Flags; node: HTMLElement }): {
      ports?: Ports;
    };
  }
}

```

The Elm for this example is too long to reasonably include in a README.
See it at `examples/all_in_one/Main/Ports.elm`.
Like the previous example, you get all the data types and ports you need, plus some wrappers around the ports that will do the decoding for you.
